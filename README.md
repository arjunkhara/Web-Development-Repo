My HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Web) projects and progress

<h3>Boxes with Arrows and Pointers</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to create arrow pointers on divs - a regularly requested feature. This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. CSS arrow divs are created by using pseudo classes in CSS, :before and :after. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/web-development-repo/blob/master/css-arrow-divs and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7JwxPnYoOw

<h3>Centering Divs Perfectly Within Other Divs</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to perfectly center a div within another, horizontally and vertically - a common problem for many frontend web designers. This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/web-development-repo/blob/master/centering-divs-horizontally-vertically-css and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJFWsggjUcE

<h3>Outlined Boxes with Arrows and Pointers</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to create an outline of a div with an arrow in-built into its perimeter, which provides an unusual look and feel on websites running CSS3 (which should be most today). This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/web-development-repo/blob/master/create-outlined-div-boxes and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgMIp4ghGr0

<h3>Slanted and Razor Blade-Shaped Boxes</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to create slanted divs and oddly-shaped or skewed boxes, which provides an unusual visual interest on websites running CSS3 (which should be most today). This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/Web-Development-Repo/blob/master/css-slanted-div-styles and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QGOhCZLdhs

<h3>Keyframe Animations</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to create keyframed animations for websites running CSS3 (which should be most today). This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/Web-Development-Repo/blob/master/css-animation-keyframes and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kve-RIl4sus

<h3>Material Design-Like Form Effects and Animations</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to make HTML forms perform the animations and behaviours commonly seen in modern websites. Google's Material Design forms have a similar appearance and behaviour, although Google uses Javascript, whereas this code uses pure CSS to achieve stylistic results. This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/Web-Development-Repo/blob/master/recreating-google-material-design-forms and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqL_sMJ25Y8

<h3>Responsive Website Design</h3>
I have created and uploaded a tutorial about creating responsive websites, i.e. websites that automatically rearrange their elements to fit the viewport of the device through which these websites are being accessed. Responsive websites are essential components of user-experience design and crucial for rankings on Google, who has publicly announced it will give precedence to sites with responsive structures. This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/Web-Development-Repo/blob/master/responsive-web-design and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JioG9Vo6TOs
