My HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Web) projects and progress

I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to create arrow pointers on divs - a regularly requested feature. This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. CSS arrow divs are created by using pseudo classes in CSS, :before and :after. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/web-development-repo/blob/master/css-arrow-divs and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7JwxPnYoOw


I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to perfectly center a div within another, horizontally and vertically - a common problem for many frontend web designers. This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/web-development-repo/blob/master/centering-divs-horizontally-vertically-css and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJFWsggjUcE


I have created and uploaded a tutorial for using CSS to create an outline of a div with an arrow in-built into its perimeter, which provides an unusual look and feel on websites running CSS3 (which should be most today). This tutorial is on my YouTube channel which I started some time ago but I'm now committing these to GitHub. The link to the code is: https://github.com/arjunkhara/web-development-repo/blob/master/create-outlined-div-boxes and the link to the video tutorial on YouTube is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgMIp4ghGr0
